# 🌍 World Wide Energy Consumption – SQL Project

---

## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing global **energy consumption**, **production**, **CO₂ emissions**, **GDP**, and **population** data using **SQL**.  
The purpose is to identify patterns, correlations, and insights related to **economic growth** and **environmental sustainability**.

---

## 🧭 Objectives
- Analyze energy consumption and production patterns across countries.
- Compare GDP and CO₂ emissions to assess efficiency.
- Identify top countries progressing toward renewable energy.
- Study the link between economic development and energy usage.

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Language:** SQL  
- **Dataset Source:** Global Open Energy Statistics  

---

## 🧹 Data Preparation Steps
1. Imported global datasets (Energy, GDP, Population, Emissions).  
2. Cleaned and standardized country names.  
3. Removed missing or duplicate data.  
4. Created relational tables and used **Primary–Foreign key** relationships.  
5. Validated data using SQL constraints and aggregations.

---

## 🧠 Methodology
- **Data Loading:** All datasets were imported into SQL tables.  
- **Exploration:** Performed exploratory SQL queries to identify consumption trends.  
- **Analysis:**  
  - Compared energy use with GDP and emissions.  
  - Identified countries with high renewable energy usage.  
  - Analyzed per capita consumption patterns.  

---

## 💡 Observations & Insights
- Countries with high GDP often show high energy consumption and CO₂ emissions.  
- Renewable energy usage is increasing but still insufficient globally.  
- Some countries (like Sweden, Norway, and Denmark) achieve strong GDP with low emissions.  
- Developing countries show rapid growth in energy demand with population rise.  
- There’s a visible correlation between **energy efficiency** and **economic stability**.

---

## 🚀 Challenges Faced
- Cleaning large, inconsistent global datasets.  
- Handling missing or corrupted records.  
- Combining multiple data sources with different formats.  
- Optimizing SQL joins and aggregations for performance.  
- Ensuring data accuracy during analysis.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
The project demonstrates how **SQL-based data analysis** can reveal meaningful insights into global energy patterns.  
A clear relationship exists between **economic growth** and **energy demand**, while **renewable adoption** remains key to sustainable progress.  
This study highlights the importance of **energy efficiency**, **policy-making**, and **data-driven decisions** for a greener future.
